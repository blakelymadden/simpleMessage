A very simple message system that currently listens on port 9999 for
incoming requests. When a connection is established, the program
sends back a packet with the string of characters given on the command
line.

***NOTE*** The code here is not necessarily secure to some kind of
manipulation. It's really just hacked together for my own practice
with network programming in C.

Usage: ./simpleMessage [message]

This will start a socket listening on port 9999. To receive the message
on a client, telnet works just fine. Telnetting to the hosting server
on port 9999 will result in <message> being sent to the telnet client
and the connection being closed immediately after.

Example: open up a terminal, type ./simpleMessage hello
        -open up another terminal, type telnet localhost 9999
        -you will receive hello on the telnet terminal before
           the connection is closed

TODO: I want to make this a full fledged messaging program where two
people can communicate over an unencrypted connection. Doing the same
thing over an encrypted connection is probably not in the pipeline, but
who knows.
